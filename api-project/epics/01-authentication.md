# Authentication and Authorization Epic

## Description

This epic covers the implementation of authentication and authorization mechanisms using Keycloak OAuth2 for client credentials flow. It includes client management in the database and secure access to API endpoints.

## User Stories

1. **Keycloak Integration**

```
As a system administrator
I want to integrate Keycloak with the API
So that clients can authenticate securely using OAuth2

Feature description:
- Implementation of OAuth2 client credentials flow with Keycloak
- Secure token validation and verification
- Integration with API security middleware

Functional requirements:
- Configure Keycloak client for the API
- Implement token validation middleware
- Handle token expiration and refresh
- Secure all API endpoints with authentication

Non-functional requirements:
- Token validation must be performant
- Secure storage of Keycloak configuration
- Proper error handling for authentication failures

Definition of done:
- Keycloak integration is complete and tested
- All endpoints require valid authentication
- Error handling is implemented
- Documentation is complete

Priority: 1
```

2. **Client Management**

```
As a system administrator
I want to manage API clients in the database
So that I can track and control API access

Feature description:
- Database schema for client management
- CRUD operations for client management
- Association of clients with their resources

Functional requirements:
- Create database schema for clients
- Store client identification and metadata
- Link clients with their templates and webhooks
- Track client usage and permissions

Non-functional requirements:
- Efficient database queries
- Proper indexing for client lookups
- Data integrity constraints

Definition of done:
- Client management database schema is implemented
- CRUD operations are tested
- Client associations work correctly
- Documentation is complete

Priority: 1
```

3. **Security Middleware**

```
As a system administrator
I want to implement security middleware
So that all API requests are properly authenticated and authorized

Feature description:
- Implementation of security middleware for API requests
- Validation of client permissions
- Request auditing

Functional requirements:
- Validate authentication tokens
- Check client permissions
- Log security-related events
- Handle unauthorized access attempts

Non-functional requirements:
- Minimal performance impact
- Proper security logging
- Scalable security checks

Definition of done:
- Security middleware is implemented
- Permission checks are working
- Logging is implemented
- Documentation is complete

Priority: 1
```
