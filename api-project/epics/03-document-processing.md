# Document Processing Epic

## Description

This epic covers the implementation of document processing functionality, including both synchronous and asynchronous processing paths, file management, and integration with LLM providers.

## User Stories

1. **File Upload and Validation**

```
As an API client
I want to upload files for processing
So that I can extract structured data from them

Feature description:
- File upload endpoint implementation
- File validation and size checking
- S3 storage integration

Functional requirements:
- Accept PDF file uploads
- Validate file size against configurable limit
- Store files in S3
- Generate unique file references
- Track file metadata

Non-functional requirements:
- Efficient file upload handling
- Secure file storage
- Proper error handling for invalid files

Definition of done:
- File upload system is implemented
- Validation works correctly
- S3 integration is complete
- Documentation is complete

Priority: 1
```

2. **Synchronous Processing**

```
As an API client
I want to process files synchronously
So that I can get immediate results for small batches

Feature description:
- Synchronous processing endpoint
- File limit enforcement per client
- Direct LLM integration

Functional requirements:
- Process files within configured limits
- Enforce per-client file limits
- Integrate with LLM providers
- Return structured results
- Handle processing errors

Non-functional requirements:
- Fast processing time
- Proper timeout handling
- Resource usage monitoring

Definition of done:
- Synchronous processing is implemented
- File limits are enforced
- Error handling is complete
- Documentation is complete

Priority: 1
```

3. **Asynchronous Processing**

```
As an API client
I want to process files asynchronously
So that I can handle large batches of files

Feature description:
- Asynchronous processing endpoint
- Queue system integration
- Background processing implementation

Functional requirements:
- Queue file processing jobs
- Process files in background
- Track job status
- Handle processing errors
- Support webhook notifications

Non-functional requirements:
- Scalable processing
- Reliable job tracking
- Efficient queue management

Definition of done:
- Asynchronous processing is implemented
- Queue system is working
- Job tracking is complete
- Documentation is complete

Priority: 1
```

4. **LLM Integration**

```
As a system administrator
I want to integrate with multiple LLM providers
So that we can support different processing options

Feature description:
- LLM provider integration
- Provider-agnostic interface
- Result parsing and standardization

Functional requirements:
- Support multiple LLM providers
- Handle provider-specific configurations
- Parse LLM responses
- Store processing results
- Handle provider errors

Non-functional requirements:
- Extensible provider system
- Efficient provider switching
- Proper error handling

Definition of done:
- LLM integration is implemented
- Provider system is extensible
- Result parsing works correctly
- Documentation is complete

Priority: 1
```
